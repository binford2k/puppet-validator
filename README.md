# Puppet Validator:
## Puppet Code Validation as a service

Puppet Validator is a simple web service that accepts arbitrary code submissions and
validates it the way `puppet parser validate` would. It can optionally also
run `puppet-lint` checks on the code and display both results together.

Puppet Validator is completely themeable, albeit rather primitively.

### Usage:

#### Running the service directly

    puppet-validator [-p <port>] [-l [logfile]] [-t <themedir>] [-d]
     ↳ Runs the Puppet Validator code validation service.

This is the simplest way to run Puppet Validator. It has no external dependencies, other
than the handful of gems it uses. This command will start the service. It will
not daemonize itself, though a [`systemd` init script is provided](#running-standalone-with-systemd)
that will take care of that for you. It will default to running on port 9000,
and will serve content directly out of its installation directory. You can
override and customize the web content by passing the `-t` or `--theme`
command-line argument. See [Creating your own theme](#creating-your-own-theme) below.

Options:

    -d, --debug                      Display or log debugging messages
    -l, --logfile [LOGFILE]          Path to logfile. Defaults to no logging, or
                                        /var/log/puppet-validator if no filename is passed.
    -p, --port PORT                  Port to listen on. Defaults to 9000.
    -t, --theme THEMEDIR             Path to the theme directory.
    -x, --csrf                       Protect from cross site request forgery. Requires code to be
                                        submitted for validation via the webpage.
    -g, --graph                      Generate relationship graphs from validated code. Requires
                                        `graphviz` to be installed.
    
    -h, --help                       Displays this help

#### Integrating with Middleware

If you plan to run this as a public service, then you may want to run it under
middleware, such as Phusion Passenger, for performance and scalability. The
specific implementation will depend on your choice of webserver and middleware.

To configure Puppet Validator on Apache and Passenger, you'll need to
<a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/install/apache/install/oss/el7/">
install and configure the appropriate packages</a>. Then you'll need to configure
a virtual host to contain the application.

``` Apache
# /etc/httpd/conf.d/puppet-validator.conf
Listen 9090
<VirtualHost *:9090>
    ServerName 54.201.129.11
    DocumentRoot /etc/puppet-validator/public
    <Directory /etc/puppet-validator/public>
        Require all granted
        Allow from all
        Options -MultiViews
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

The `DocumentRoot` and `Directory` directives can point directly to the `public`
directory *within the gem installation directory*, or it can point to the `public`
directory of a custom theme you've created. See
[Creating your own theme](#creating-your-own-theme) below. The two directives
should point to the same directory.

In the directory directly above the `public` directory referenced above, you
should have a `config.ru` file. This file will actually bootstrap and start the
application. An example file exists in the root of the gem installation directory.
It looks similar to the file below and may be customized to pass in any options
you'd like.

``` Ruby
# /etc/puppet-validator/config.ru
require 'rubygems'
require 'puppet-validator'

logger       = Logger.new('/var/log/puppet-validator')
logger.level = Logger::WARN

PuppetValidator.set :puppet_versions, Dir.glob('*').select {|f| File.symlink? f and File.readlink(f) == '.' }
PuppetValidator.set :root, File.dirname(__FILE__)
PuppetValidator.set :logger, logger

# List out the lint checks you want disabled. By default, this will enable
#   all installed checks. puppet-lint --help will list known checks.
#
PuppetValidator.set :disabled_lint_checks, ['80chars']

# Protect from cross site request forgery. With this set, code may be
#   submitted for validation by the website only.
#
# Note: This will currently break multiple version validation.
PuppetValidator.set :csrf, false

# Provide the option to generate relationship graphs from validated code.
#   This requires that the `graphviz` package be installed.
#
PuppetValidator.set :graph, false

run PuppetValidator
```

#### Creating your own theme

Creating a Puppet Validator theme is as simple as copying the content files to a directory
and customizing them. The `init` subcommand will do this for you. Note that the
command *will overwrite* existing files, but it will warn you before it does so.

    root@master:~ # mkdir /etc/puppet-validator
    root@master:~ # cd /etc/puppet-validator/
    root@master:/etc/puppet-validator # puppet-validator init
    Initializing directory as new Puppet Validator theme...
    root@master:/etc/puppet-validator # tree
    .
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── config.ru
    ├── public
    │   ├── info.png
    │   ├── prism-default.css
    │   ├── prism.js
    │   ├── styles.css
    │   └── testing.html
    └── views
        ├── index.erb
        └── result.erb

Once you've created your theme, you can start the Puppet Validator service using the `-t`
or `--theme` command line arguments to tell Puppet Validator where to find your content.

    root@master:~ # puppet-validator -t /etc/puppet-validator/

Alternatively, you can edit your webserver virtual host configuration to point
to the *public* directory within your new theme, as in the example shown above.

#### Disabling `puppet-lint` checks

Puppet-lint is an incredibly valuable tool. That said, some of the checks it runs
may not apply to your environment. It's easy to disable these checks, either on
the command-line, or in the `config.ru` file. By default, Puppet Validator will just run
all available checks.

Checks can be disabled either as a comma-separated list of checks:

    root@master:~ # puppet-validator --disable 80chars,double_quoted_strings

Or in a file with one check per line.

    root@master:~ # puppet-validator --disable /etc/puppet-validator/disabled_checks
    root@master:~ # cat /etc/puppet-validator/disabled_checks
    80chars
    double_quoted_strings

This can also be done in your `config.ru`. Specifying a list would look like this:

``` Ruby
PuppetValidator.set :disabled_lint_checks, ['80chars', 'double_quoted_strings']

```

And loading the disabled checks from a file would look like:

``` Ruby
PuppetValidator.set :disabled_lint_checks, '/etc/puppet-validator/disabled_checks'

```

#### Validating code against multiple Puppet versions

It is not very straightforward to load multiple versions of a library gem in Ruby.
This makes it virtually impossible to validate multiple versions of the language
directly in the tool. However, Passenger has allowed you to load different Ruby
versions in different `Location` blocks since version 4.0 by loading separate
threads for each.

We can take advantage of that by configuring multiple Ruby environments using `rvm`
or `rbenv` and installing different gemsets. A simple Puppet module to do this
is included in the repository, with the caveat that it was designed to fully own
a single-purpose VM and has so far only been tested on CentOS 7.

If configuring manually, you'll need to create a gemset for each Puppet version
you want to validate, with something like the following.

    root@master:~ # rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p551
    Searching for binary rubies, this might take some time.
    [...]
    root@master:~ # rvm use 1.9
    Using /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551
    root@master:~ # rvm gemset create puppet2.7.4
    ruby-1.9.3-p551 - #gemset created /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551@puppet2.7.4
    ruby-1.9.3-p551 - #generating puppet2.7.4 wrappers........
    root@master:~ # rvm gemset use puppet2.7.4
    Using ruby-1.9.3-p551 with gemset puppet2.7.4
    root@master:~ # gem install puppet -v 2.7.4
    [...]
    root@master:~ # gem install puppet-validator
    [...]
    root@master:~ # passenger-config --ruby-command
    passenger-config was invoked through the following Ruby interpreter:
      Command: /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551@puppet2.7.4/wrappers/ruby
      Version: ruby 1.9.3p551 (2014-11-13 revision 48407) [x86_64-linux]
      To use in Apache: PassengerRuby /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551@puppet2.7.4/wrappers/ruby
      To use in Nginx : passenger_ruby /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551@puppet2.7.4/wrappers/ruby
      To use with Standalone: /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551@puppet2.7.4/wrappers/ruby /usr/bin/passenger start
    
    
    ## Notes for RVM users
    Do you want to know which command to use for a different Ruby interpreter? 'rvm use' that Ruby interpreter, then re-run 'passenger-config about ruby-command'.
    
Make a note of the `PassengerRuby` command for each gemset. You'll use it in the next step.

You will need a `Location` block in your Apache `VirtualHost` for each versioned
Puppet gemset you created above. The example file below shows blocks for three
Puppet versions with the current version installed into the default directory.

``` Apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName vhost.example.com
  DocumentRoot "/var/www/puppet-validator/public"

  # The default root will validate against the current Puppet version
  <Directory "/var/www/puppet-validator/public">
    Options -MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
  </Directory>

  Alias /2.7.4 /var/www/puppet-validator/2.7.4/public
  <Location /2.7.4>
    PassengerBaseURI /2.7.4
    PassengerAppRoot /var/www/puppet-validator/2.7.4
    PassengerRuby "/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551@puppet2.7.4/wrappers/ruby"
  </Location>

  Alias /3.6.2 /var/www/puppet-validator/3.6.2/public
  <Location /3.6.2>
    PassengerBaseURI /3.6.2
    PassengerAppRoot /var/www/puppet-validator/3.6.2
    PassengerRuby "/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551@puppet3.6.2/wrappers/ruby"
  </Location>

  ## Logging
  ErrorLog "/var/log/httpd/vhost.example.com_error.log"
  ServerSignature Off
  CustomLog "/var/log/httpd/vhost.example.com_access.log" combined
</VirtualHost>
```

There is one final trick. Passenger requires a unique filesystem location for its
`AppRoot`. However, it will respect symlinks, so let's create one for each version:

    root@master:~ # cd /var/www/puppet-validator
    root@master:~ # ln -s . 2.7.4
    root@master:~ # ln -s . 3.6.2

Now restart Apache and you're all gravy.

#### Running standalone with `systemd`

A simple `systemd` init script might look something like:

    # /usr/lib/systemd/system/puppet-validator.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Puppet Validator
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=puppet-validator
    Restart=on-failure
    KillSignal=SIGINT

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Customize the command line as needed. You might include a `--theme` or `--port`
argument, or you might provide the full path to an `rvm` installed gem.
